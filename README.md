Mini Project - Solar Power Output Prediction using Machine Learning

# 🌞 Solar Power Output Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Accurate prediction of solar power output plays a critical role in improving the efficiency and reliability of renewable energy systems. This project focuses on building a robust machine learning pipeline to forecast solar energy generation using historical and weather-related data. It is designed for researchers, engineers, and sustainability professionals who are working on energy management and planning.

## ❗ Problem Statement

The unpredictable nature of solar power generation, due to weather and environmental variability, poses a challenge to reliable energy planning and integration into the power grid. Traditional forecasting methods often fail to accurately model these non-linear patterns, leading to inefficiencies, energy waste, or over-dependence on non-renewable backup sources.

This project addresses the need for accurate solar power output prediction using machine learning techniques, which can learn from historical data and detect complex patterns. The goal is to improve the accuracy of solar forecasts to support better energy management, enhance grid stability, and promote sustainable use of renewable resources.
